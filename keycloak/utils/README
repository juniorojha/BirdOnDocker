This dockerfile is designed to build on the latest official jboss keycloak docker file. This additionally provides root access with git installed - which is not avaibale in the official image.
It is handy if you want to do a docker exec and explore a running container.
You can edit your github credentials and export files from a running container to your github - you may want to do this in case you want to use certain files which are not provided separately but are used during the build of the official docker image.
